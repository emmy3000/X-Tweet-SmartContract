# X-Tweet Smart Contract

## Overview
**X-Tweet Smart Contract** is a decentralized application (DApp) that facilitates information and asset exchange on the Ethereum Blockchain Network.

## Project Structure
The project follows a standard directory structure:
```bash
X-Tweet-SmartContract/
├── contract/
│   └── X-Tweet.sol
├── tests/
│   └── X-Tweet.test.js
├── .eslintrc.js
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── node_modules/
├── package.json
└── package-lock.json
```

## Configuration Files
The project includes the following configuration files:

- `.eslintrc`: ESLint configuration file for code linting.
- `babel.config.js`: Babel configuration file for JavaScript transpilation.
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json`: Dependency and project metadata files.

## Usage
To use the X-Tweet Smart Contract, follow these steps:

- To compile Solidity code into bytecode for execution on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), it's recommended to install the Solidity compiler (`solc`) as a system-wide package. Here's how you can install `solc` globally and update it to the latest stable version if needed:
```bash
# Install `solc` globally if not already installed.
npm install -g solc

# Update `solc` to the latest stable version if outdated.
npm update -g solc
```
- Create a `.gitignore` file and populate it with the names of sensitive applications that should not be pushed to the remote repository, execute the following commands assuming the `.gitignore` file already exists contained properly defined configurations:
```bash
# Add `.gitignore` to a staging area.
git add .gitignore

# Commit changes implemented in `.gitignore` with a descriptive message.
git commit -m "Prevent pushing sensitive apps to a remote repository."

# Push `.gitignore` to the "master" branch in a remote repository.
git push origin master
```
- Initialize the project by creating a `package.json` configuration file containing the project's metadata and important dependencies residing in an isolated local scoped environment and capable of being fully controlled making it the suited the project's build at the development phase, These following commands executes the project's initialization:
```bash
# Initialize the project starting with its metadata and functionalities populated interactively.
npm init

# Initialize the project swiftly with some basic configured functionalities populated automatically.
npm init -y
```
- Set up essential configuration file scripts to handle tasks such as linting and code transpilation.
```bash
# Create the configuration files.
touch .eslintrc.js babel-config.js

# Open both files with a text editor like Vim to resume or update set-up definitions.
vim .eslintrc.js
vim babel-config.js
```
- Install the required dependencies needed for the project's development after implementing their definitions in the `package.json` configuration file:
```bash
# Install the dependency values assigned to both 'dependencies' and 'devDependencies' object properties.
npm install
```
- Configure any required environment variables.
- Deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
- Interact with the contract using the provided APIs.
